This is a private readme. Check `README.md` for the public file.

Here I set the private stuff I don't want to public with the employer regarding the trials in [this file](./Prueba_tecnica_Python.pdf)

## Planning

### Trial 1 - Create a chatbot with gradio and phi-2

Gor for an MVP - basic communication with the chatbot

+ [x] Start with phi-2
  + [x] Download and run
  + [x] Experiment with the model
+ [ ] Create a chatbot interface with gradio
  + [x] Install gradio
  + [x] First run gradio on jupyter notebook
  + [x] Launch gradio standalone
  + [ ] Customise the gradio experience to make the UI somehow distingtive
+ [ ] Link the interface with phi-2
  + [ ] Basic chatbot using just the output from phi-2 straight away
+ [ ] Clean the code
  + [ ] Structure the code in modules and functions
  + [ ] Comment and explain
  + [ ] Pay attention to directory structure
  + [ ] Make officital README file with simple explanations (this file should include steps and reasoning)

+ [ ] Improve the chatbot by adding some templates and context information to the chatbot
  + [ ] Do simple manual templates
  + [ ] Use langchain

Improve the chatbot

+ [ ] Experiment with simple templates to give the chatbot some personality and more capabilities
+ [ ] Add memory to the chatbot
+ [ ] Maybe use langchain to address those issues
